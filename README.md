## Locations of note:

Everything important should be in the root directory of this repo. 

Screenshots are entitled `Excel Screenshot-\<year\>` for years 2018, 2019, and 2020 in the workbook.

The Macro code is stored under `SummarizeData.cls`.

There is also a flowchart I made in Obsidian which I decided to include here as well. It's entitled `Module 2 Flowchart.png`.
